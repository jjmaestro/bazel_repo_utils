# `archives` repository rule

Repository rule to create and maintain Bazel external repos. It helps reduce
boilerplate code by keeping a JSON index file with all of the metadata required
to download and extract an archive: the archive's `version`(s) and the
`source`(s) from which to try to download the archive.

<a id="archives"></a>

## archives

<pre>
archives(<a href="#archives-name">name</a>, <a href="#archives-index">index</a>, <a href="#archives-patches">patches</a>, <a href="#archives-repo_mapping">repo_mapping</a>, <a href="#archives-sources">sources</a>, <a href="#archives-versions">versions</a>)
</pre>

This repository rule wraps [`rctx.download_and_extract`] and creates a Bazel
repo under `@<REPO_NAME>`, downloading and extracting *one archive* from *one*
of the sources for *each* of the archive versions in the [repo JSON index].

When downloading the archive, if a source fails it will try the next one, and
only fail if all sources are exhausted.

To construct the arguments passed to [`rctx.download_and_extract`] it uses the
["materialized repo `context`"], which includes at minimum the materialized
`url` from which to download the archive.

### Repo structure

```
  @<REPO_NAME>/
   |
   |-- <VERSION>/
   |   |-- BUILD.bazel
   |   `-- <SOURCE>/
   |       |-- BUILD.bazel
   |       |-- ...
   |       `-- ...
   |
   |-- BUILD.bazel
   |-- index.json
   |-- lock.json
   |-- metadata.json
   |-- repo.bzl
   `-- patches/
       |-- <VERSION>/
           `-- <SOURCE>/
               |-- <PATCH_NAME>
               `-- ...
```

TL;DR, the repo can be used as follows:

- `@<REPO_NAME>//:<REPO_NAME>`: points to the `:files` target of the
  `DEFAULT_VERSION`.
- `@<REPO_NAME>//:<TARGET>`: points to the specific `TARGET` of the
  `DEFAULT_VERSION`.
- `@<REPO_NAME>//<VERSION>:<TARGET>`: points to the specific `TARGET` of that
  `VERSION`.

The `archives` repository rule creates a `@<REPO_NAME>` Bazel repo with a
public `//<VERSION>` package for every version in the index.

Each `//<VERSION>` package has three targets:
- `:files`: to access all the files in the downloaded archive.
- `:dir`: the path to the directory where the archive was extracted.
- `:<VERSION>`: `alias` of `:files`.

and two constants:
- `VERSION`: the version of the archive.
- `SOURCE`: the source from which the archive was downloaded.

Each `//<VERSION>` package has an *internal* `<SOURCE>` sub-package with
the actual files from the downloaded archive for that specific `version` and
`source`. The targets in the `//<VERSION>` package are aliases for targets in
the `//<VERSION>/<SOURCE>` sub-packages.

The root package `//` has three targets:
- `:files`: to access all the files in the `DEFAULT_VERSION` package.
- `:dir`: the path to the directory of the `DEFAULT_VERSION` package.
- `:<REPO_NAME>`: `alias` of `:files`.

and two constants:
- `VERSION`: the `DEFAULT_VERSION` of the archive.
- `SOURCE`: the source from which the default version was downloaded.

The root package also has the following:
- `//:index.json`: a copy of the repo index JSON file.
- `//:lock.json`: the repo lock file (see below).
- `//:metadata.json`: the repo metadata.
- `//:repo.bzl`: extension with the following constants:
  - `REPO_NAME`: The short repo name.
  - `SOURCES`: a mapping of the downloaded `version`s to the `source` from
    which the archive was downloaded.
  - `DEFAULT_VERSION`: the default `version` of the archive.
  - `LOCK`: a `dict` with the contents of the repo `lock.json`.
  - `METADATA`: the free-form metadata map straight from the repo JSON index,
    if any.
- `//patches`: a package with `<VERSION>/<SOURCE>` sub-packages with the
  applied patches applied to that archive, if any (see ["Patching"] below).

The repo lock file contains a mapping of the downloaded `version` to a "lock
object" with the following properties:
  - `source`: the source from which the archive was downloaded.
  - `url`: the URL from which the archive was downloaded.
  - `integrity`: the SRI ([Subresource Integrity (SRI)]) of the downloaded archive.
  - `patches`: the list of patches applied to the archive after download, if any.

["Patching"]: #patching
[Subresource Integrity (SRI)]: https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/
["materialized repo `context`"]: ../../lib/index.md#materialized-repo-context
[`rctx.download_and_extract`]: https://bazel.build/rules/lib/builtins/repository_ctx#download_and_extract
[repo JSON index]: ../../lib/index.md

### Selecting `versions` and `sources`

Users can also override the default selection of versions and sources with the
`versions` and `sources` arguments.

Note that selecting specific versions and/or arguments will change the values
of `VERSIONS` and `DEFAULT_VERSION`.

### Version scheme

The version scheme is the format used for versions in both the
`index` and `patches`. For now, the only version scheme supported is [semantic
versioning] ([`version_utils`' `SCHEME.SEMVER` `version`]).

[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org
[`version_utils`' `SCHEME.SEMVER` `version`]: https://github.com/jjmaestro/bazel_version_utils/blob/main/docs/version/version.md

### Patching

The downloaded archive can also be patched by passing a `patches` argument, a
map of `Label`s of [unified diff format] patch files (applied from the root of
the downloaded archive) to "patch specs" that determine if the patch is to be
applied.

The "patch spec" format is `<VERSION_SPEC>[/<SOURCE>]`, where:

- `<VERSION_SPEC>` is a version constraints requirement spec that
  to specify the versions to which the patch applies.
- `<SOURCE>` (optional, defaults to `*`) is the source of the downloaded
  archive to which the patch should be applied. It's optional and it can also
  be `*`, a wildcard to apply the patch to the archives downloaded from any
  source.

The `<VERSION_SPEC>` syntax is [`version_utils`' `SYNTAX.SIMPLE` `spec`].

This helps to maintain patches that apply to e.g.:

- a specific version and source: `1.24.5/github`
- a specific version and all sources: `1.24.5/*` or `1.24.5`
- a range of versions and all sources: `>=1.24.5, <2.0.0/*`
- all versions and sources: `*` or `*/*`

Finally, to simplify patch maintenance, it's good practice to keep a dedicated
"patched branch" for each version we want to maintain, making it easy to
generate the list of patches using [`git format-patch`].

### Usage:

Here's an example that shows how to create a `@wget_src` repo for [GNU wget]:

[GNU wget]: https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/

#### 1. Create the repo index

First, define a `repo.json` JSON index file in a package. Don't forget to add a
`BUILD.bazel` file in it if one doesn't already exists).

E.g. for a `//third-party/wget` package:

```sh
mkdir -p third-party/wget
touch third-party/wget/BUILD.bazel
```

Then add the following to the `repo.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "sources": {
    "github.com": {
      "owner": "mirror",
      "repo": "wget",
      "tag": "v{version}",
      "url": "https://{source}/{owner}/{repo}/archive/refs/tags/{tag}.tar.gz",
      "strip_prefix": "{repo}-{version}"
    },
    "gitlab.com": {
      "owner": "gnuwget",
      "repo": "wget",
      "tag": "v{version}",
      "filename": "{repo}-{tag}",
      "url": "https://{source}/{owner}/{repo}/-/archive/{tag}/{filename}.tar.gz",
      "strip_prefix": "{filename}"
    }
  },
  "versions": {
    "1.24.5": {
      "integrity": {
        "gitlab.com": "sha256-1Yw1cok0niLv563o07/BrjbCQIflWxK8UFlav9srtcw="
      }
    },
    "1.21.3": {
        "github.com": "sha256-VbH6fHnent2TtbYxbNoatK4RNkY3MVPXokJhRzPZBg8=",
        "gitlab.com": "sha256-3w3ImvW4t/H2eMkZbUH+F1zkARSI3cIJSgJFg4ULPU4="
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Add the `download_archives` repo to `MODULE.bazel`

Then, add the following to `MODULE.bazel`:

```starlark
download_archives = use_repo_rule("@repo_utils//download/archives:defs.bzl", "download_archives")

download_archives(
    name = "wget_src",
    index = "//third-party/wget:repo.json",
    # NOTE:
    # This is how you would add a custom patch for one of the versions. See
    # "Patching" docs for more information about patches.
    # patches = {
    #    "//third-party/wget/patches:0001-1.24.5-test-patch.patch": ">=1.24.5/*",
    # },
)
```

#### 3. Test it

To test the Bazel repo, run `bazel fetch @wget_src`. This will attempt to
download and extract all the versions defined in the repo index from the
available sources.

As mentioned before, it will stop downloading any other source for a specific
version when there's a successful download from one source. And, if all
downloads from all sources of a given version fail, it will `fail` with an
error.

Note that in the `repo.json` JSON index file there's one `integrity` missing
for one of the sources (version `1.24.5`, source `github.com`). When this
happens a warning message is printed when the archive download begins asking
the user to add the integrity to the index. And, if the archive is successfully
downloaded, a message with the [Subresource Integrity (SRI)] (`integrity`) and
`SHA256` hex digest will be printed so that it's easy to copy-paste one of them
in the index.

Once installed, the `@wget_src` repo will have the following:

- helper constants available to import from `@wget_src//:repo.bzl`:
  - `REPO_NAME = "wget_src"`
  - `VERSIONS = {"1.24.5": "github.com", "1.21.3": "github.com"}`
  - `DEFAULT_VERSION = "1.24.5"`
  - `LOCK = {...}` (the contents of the repo `lock.json`)

- specific `<VERSION>/<SOURCE>` repos:
  - `@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com`
  - `@wget_src//1.21.3/github.com`

- `alias` repos:
  - `@wget_src` --> `@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com`
  - `@wget_src//1.24.5` --> `@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com`
  - `@wget_src//1.21.3` --> `@wget_src//1.21.3/github.com`

<details>
<summary><h4>More details</h4></summary>

To list all the targets in the repo, run `bazel query @wget_src//...`:

```sh
@wget_src//:dir
@wget_src//:files
@wget_src//:wget_src
@wget_src//1.21.3:1.21.3
@wget_src//1.21.3:dir
@wget_src//1.21.3:files
@wget_src//1.21.3/github.com:dir
@wget_src//1.21.3/github.com:files
@wget_src//1.21.3/github.com:github.com
@wget_src//1.24.5:1.24.5
@wget_src//1.24.5:dir
@wget_src//1.24.5:files
@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com:dir
@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com:files
@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com:github.com
```

In cases where we have many versions and sources in the index we can select the
versions and/or sources from which to download using the `versions` and
`sources` arguments:

```starlark
download_archives(
    name = "wget_src",
    index = "//third-party/wget:repo.json",
    versions = ["1.21.3"],
    sources = ["gitlab.com"],
)
```

Selecting `versions` and `sources` changes what's installed and available in
the `@wget_src` repo:

- helper constants available to import from `@wget_src//:repo.bzl`:
  - `REPO_NAME = "wget_src"`
  - `VERSIONS = {"1.21.3": "gitlab.com"}`
  - `DEFAULT_VERSION = "1.21.3"`

- specific `<VERSION>/<SOURCE>` repos:
  - `@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com`

- `alias` repos:
  - `@wget_src` --> `@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com`
  - `@wget_src//1.21.3` --> `@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com`

Again, let's list all the targets with `bazel query @wget_src//...`:

```sh
@wget_src//:dir
@wget_src//:files
@wget_src//:wget_src
@wget_src//1.21.3:1.21.3
@wget_src//1.21.3:dir
@wget_src//1.21.3:files
@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com:dir
@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com:files
@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com:gitlab.com
```

Similarly, remember that the sources are used as "mirrors" so if the first one
fails to download, the next source will be attempted. Thus, the `VERSIONS`
helper constant, the `alias` repos and the repo `lock.json` will all change
accordingly.

For example, imagine that `github` has version `1.24.5` available but not
`1.21.3`. Then, the download will fall back to the `gitlab.com` source and, if
successful, the `@wget_src` repo will have the following:

- helper constants available to import from `@wget_src//:repo.bzl`:
  - `REPO_NAME = "wget_src"`
  - `VERSIONS = {"1.24.5": "github.com", "1.21.3": "gitlab.com"}`
  - `DEFAULT_VERSION = "1.24.5"`
  - `LOCK = {...}` (the new contents of the repo `lock.json`)

- specific `<VERSION>/<SOURCE>` repos:
  - `@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com`
  - `@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com`

- `alias` repos:
  - `@wget_src` --> `@wget_src//1.24.5/github`
  - `@wget_src//1.24.5` --> `@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com`
  - `@wget_src//1.21.3` --> `@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com`


In this case, the list of targets would look like:

```sh
@wget_src//:dir
@wget_src//:files
@wget_src//:wget_src
@wget_src//1.21.3:1.21.3
@wget_src//1.21.3:dir
@wget_src//1.21.3:files
@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com:dir
@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com:files
@wget_src//1.21.3/gitlab.com:gitlab.com
@wget_src//1.24.5:1.24.5
@wget_src//1.24.5:dir
@wget_src//1.24.5:files
@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com:dir
@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com:files
@wget_src//1.24.5/github.com:github.com
```
